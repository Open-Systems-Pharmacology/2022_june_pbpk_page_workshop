# Leveraging in vitro data for MIDD pre-PAGE 2-day workshop 

Dear OSP Github users,
 
In connection with Page 2022 in Ljubljana, Pharmetheus will offer a pre-conference workshop for those of you who have an interest in PBPK with a focus on both IVIVE for FIH prediction and IVIVC for virtual BE trials; please find some information below.


### PBPK modelling with the OSPSuite: leveraging in vitro data for MIDD
27-28th of June 2022, 2-day workshop
 
### Workshop overview:
The workshop will feature PBPK modelling with the Open Systems Pharmacology suite (OSPS). The combination of use cases based on published examples and hands-on lectures will enable the participants to build their own PBPK projects and maximise their impact by integrating physiological and mechanistic knowledge with preclinical and clinical information. While the workshop is aimed for intermediate levels with PK-Sim® & MoBi®, many topics will be of interest even for beginners or more advanced users.
 
The goals of the workshop are:

* To get an in-depth understanding of PBPK informed drug development with a focus on informing first human PK prediction and Biopharmaceutics

* To learn how to leverage preclinical in vitro and in vivo data for IVIVE and First In Human (FIH) predictions

* To learn how to leverage in vitro dissolution data for virtual bioequivalence trials

### Workshop faculty:
Marylore Chenel, Ph.D.
Erik Sjögren, Assoc. Prof, Ph.D.
Tobias Kanacher. Ph.D.
